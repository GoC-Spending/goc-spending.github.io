<h1 id="analyzing-goc-contract-spending">Analyzing GoC Contract Spending</h1>

<p>This website is a volunteer-run analysis of Government of Canada contract spending. The federal government spends more than $X each year in competitive or sole-sourced contracts.</p>

<p>Since the mid-2000s, contracts larger than $10,000 have been published on each department’s <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/reporting-government-spending/proactive-disclosure-department-agency.html">Proactive Disclosure</a> websites. Publishing contracting information is intended to improve transparency and public trust in government contracting and spending decisions.</p>

<p>Although departments have published contracting data for more than a decade, the format in which it was published – on individual departmental webpages for each contract or amendment – made it difficult to analyze at scale.</p>

<p>Since 2016, departments have begun <a href="https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/d8f85d91-7dec-4fd1-8055-483b77225d8b">publishing contracting data on the Open Government website</a> in a government-wide CSV dataset. This dataset is much easier to analyze, but does not include historical data for most departments.</p>

<p>In order to build a government-wide, historical dataset of Government of Canada contract spending, volunteers from Ottawa Civic Tech built <a href="https://github.com/GoC-Spending/">a collection of website scrapers and other analysis tools</a>. These tools collected data from <span class="variable">84</span> departments, merged it together, detected duplicate entries, matched sets of contract amendments together, and calculated aggregate statistics.</p>

<p>[sample government-wide chart here, e.g. total contract/amendment entries by fiscal quarter]</p>

<p>The resulting dataset is the first volunteer-led, public, historical analysis of Canadian federal government contract spending at a whole-of-government level. <a href="/methodology">Learn more about the methodology and data</a>, <a href="/analysis">review the initial analysis and trends</a>, or <a href="/download">download the data</a> to identify insights of your own.</p>
